Product Margins in Invoices
===========================

This module computes product's margin based on the invoice lines.

It adds a new report :

* Reporting \ Accounting \Â Product Maring on Invoices

This report is showing the following columns :

* group: the main grouping column, by default the product
* Manuf. Cost: the 'Cost price' field from the product
* List Price: the 'List Price' field from the product
* Gross Margin on list price: calculated as List price - Cost price
* Gross Margin on list price (%): Gross Margin on list price rate
* Avg. Invoiced Price: Average price in customer invoices
* Gross Margin on invoices: calculated as Average Invoiced Price - Cost price
* Gross Margin on invoices (%): Gross Margin on invoices rate
* Total Margin on cost: calculated as Gross Margin on invoices * qty

All prices are in the company's main currency

Backround

currency.
